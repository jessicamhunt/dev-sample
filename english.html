          Although Miyax has finally made friends with Amaroq and the other
          wolves in his pack, she is still struggling to survive. Getting Jello
          to share some meat from his "belly basket" had been a desperate and
          dangerous move on her part, and she can't rely on this method forever.
          The next time she tries, he might attack her instead of giving in to
          his "babysitting" instincts.

          Throughout the rest of Part I of Julie of the Wolves, the protagonist
          continues her quest to stay alive in spite of the harshness of the
          elements, a shortage of food, and her loneliness. Some of the words
          below may be unfamiliar to you, and yet they will be helpful in
          understanding Miyax's difficult situation even after winning Amaroq's
          trust.
