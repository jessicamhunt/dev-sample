                Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and
                beliefs that can be seen among Americans collectively, there are
                thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which
                citizens can belong. The terms group and organization are very
                loose and can be interpreted very broadly. Some groups are very
                general and open to all without question while others may have
                specific goals or very selective membership. They can be
                economically motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue
                organizations. However, we can break them down into political
                organizations, interest groups, voluntary and civic
                associations, unions, and religious groups. View the slideshow

                      Political organizations have the general goal of trying to
                      either influence or take control of government to achieve
                      outcomes. Political parties, such as the Democrats,
                      Republicans, and Libertarians, all fall in the category,
                      but one might also find groups such as FreedomWorks or the
                      Center for American Progress. Depending on the group or
                      organization, citizens may find membership in them a
                      challenge as political parties often take time to join in
                      an active level, or groups may insist on alignment with
                      philosophical goals.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      Interest groups tend to be centered on a common goal or
                      idea. These groups run the table in terms of interests and
                      concerns, including the National Organization for Women,
                      La Raza, National Right to Life, and the National Rifle
                      Association. Many could be considered political as they
                      have aims to influence leadership. However, membership
                      tends to be less restrictive as many look for volunteers
                      to help spread their messages and ideas.

                      Volunteering and civic participation tends to be the most
                      local level of group membership. Often parts of larger
                      organizations, these groups are often charitable, and work
                      for general causes, or serve as a means of fraternal
                      support. Such groups differ widely, with some very open to
                      anyone interested, such as the Red Cross or United Way,
                      and others with very selective membership procedures, such
                      as the Elks or Freemasons.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      Unions were created to support the needs of workers in
                      various fields of industry and service and are responsible
                      for helping to promote safe workplaces and fair labor
                      practices. Over the years, unions have often increased
                      their activities to include charitable works and political
                      involvement to support candidates and ideas that serve to
                      aid their general membership. Unions include the AFL-CIO
                      and the NEA. Union membership is selective in that one
                      must usually be employed in a particular field to join;
                      however, in some places union membership is actually
                      mandatory by state law if employed in certain jobs.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      Religious groups is a very broad category as it can refer
                      to specific religious denominations or sects, or it can
                      refer to organizations and societies that support the
                      views of particular religions and belief systems. For
                      example, entire denominations have lobbying organizations
                      to petition on their behalf. Other organizations exist to
                      promote the ideas of a religious group, such as the
                      Anti-Defamation League, which exists to prevent
                      persecution of Jewish citizens, and the Knights of
                      Columbus, an association of Catholic men. Generally,
                      membership in groups requires adherence to the beliefs of
                      the sect or denomination, but some have more stringent
                      requirements for participation.

                Yes. Many organizations could fall under the idea of political
                organizations or interest groups since they tend to aim for
                political influence and focus on areas of common interest.
                However, some are more explicitly political, while others have
                politics as a goal among many.
