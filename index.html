            Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and
            beliefs that can be seen among Americans collectively, there are
            thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which
            citizens can belong. The terms group and organization are very loose
            and can be interpreted very broadly. Some groups are very general
            and open to all without question while others may have specific
            goals or very selective membership. They can be economically
            motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue organizations.
            However, we can break them down into political organizations,
            interest groups, voluntary and civic associations, unions, and
            religious groups. View the slideshow below to learn more.

                  <h1>Political Organizations</h1>
                  <p>
                    Political organizations have the general goal of trying to
                    either influence or take control of government to achieve
                    outcomes. Political parties, such as the Democrats,
                    Republicans, and Libertarians, all fall in the category, but
                    one might also find groups such as FreedomWorks or the
                    Center for American Progress. Depending on the group or
                    organization, citizens may find membership in them a
                    challenge as political parties often take time to join in an
                    active level, or groups may insist on alignment with
                    philosophical goals.

                  <h1>Interest Groups</h1>
                  <p>
                    Interest groups tend to be centered on a common goal or
                    idea. These groups run the table in terms of interests and
                    concerns, including the National Organization for Women, La
                    Raza, National Right to Life, and the National Rifle
                    Association. Many could be considered political as they have
                    aims to influence leadership. However, membership tends to
                    be less restrictive as many look for volunteers to help
                    spread their messages and ideas.

                  <h1>Voluntary and Civic Associations</h1>
                  <p>
                    Volunteering and civic participation tends to be the most
                    local level of group membership. Often parts of larger
                    organizations, these groups are often charitable, and work
                    for general causes, or serve as a means of fraternal
                    support. Such groups differ widely, with some very open to
                    anyone interested, such as the Red Cross or United Way, and
                    others with very selective membership procedures, such as
                    the Elks or Freemasons.

                  <h1>Unions</h1>
                  <p>
                    Unions were created to support the needs of workers in
                    various fields of industry and service and are responsible
                    for helping to promote safe workplaces and fair labor
                    practices. Over the years, unions have often increased their
                    activities to include charitable works and political
                    involvement to support candidates and ideas that serve to
                    aid their general membership. Unions include the AFL-CIO and
                    the NEA. Union membership is selective in that one must
                    usually be employed in a particular field to join; however,
                    in some places union membership is actually mandatory by
                    state law if employed in certain jobs.

                  <h1>Religious Groups</h1>
                  <p>
                    Religious groups is a very broad category as it can refer to
                    specific religious denominations or sects, or it can refer
                    to organizations and societies that support the views of
                    particular religions and belief systems. For example, entire
                    denominations have lobbying organizations to petition on
                    their behalf. Other organizations exist to promote the ideas
                    of a religious group, such as the Anti-Defamation League,
                    which exists to prevent persecution of Jewish citizens, and
                    the Knights of Columbus, an association of Catholic men.
                    Generally, membership in groups requires adherence to the
                    beliefs of the sect or denomination, but some have more
                    stringent requirements for participation.

                Yes. Many organizations could fall under the idea of political
                organizations or interest groups since they tend to aim for
                political influence and focus on areas of common interest.
                However, some are more explicitly political, while others have
                politics as a goal among many.
